first we start of with mounting

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

then we install rasterio

pip install rasterio

## K-means Clustering Example

This section of the notebook demonstrates the use of K-means clustering on synthetically generated data to understand the algorithm's application.

### Dependencies Installation

Before running the clustering, ensure that the necessary Python library `netCDF4` is installed. This library is essential for handling scientific data formats:

```bash
!pip install netCDF4


## Example of K-means Clustering

This example demonstrates how to apply K-means clustering to a simple synthetic dataset. The code performs the following steps:

### Import Libraries

- `KMeans` from `sklearn.cluster`: This is used for applying the K-means clustering algorithm.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting: Helps in visualizing the data points and the results of clustering.
- `numpy`: Used for generating sample data and performing high-level mathematical functions.

### Generate Sample Data
